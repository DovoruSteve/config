# config

Config server for Robot Server and Robot Client.
This must be installed aned running before the Robot Server and Robot Client can be compiled / run

Installation
 
	Java 17 or newer is required to compile and / or run the robot client.

	Maven 3 or newer is required only if you want to recompile and run the unit tests.

	Download / clone the repo. I've included the jar so you can run it without rebuilding it.

	Once downloaded (and extracted, if you downloaded the zip), open a shell (or command window
	on Windows), and run it by changing into the config directory and running 

	     java -jar target/config-0.0.1.jar

	The next step is to download / clone the robotserver from the following URL
